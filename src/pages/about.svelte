  The Command Post is an collection of <i>unofficial</i> missions offering an extra tactical layer to your game of Bolt Action.

<p>
  Missions are intended as a supplement to the main objective of the scenario played. Using missions, each player gets assigned a <strong>secondary objective</strong>. Succeeding or failing this objective can influence the outcome of game.

  As a bonus, The Command Post helps you automate the process of deciding on a scenario to play, and assigning a secret mission to each player.
