<p>
  The Command Post is an collection of <strong>unofficial</strong> missions offering an extra tactical layer to your game of Bolt Action.
</p>

<p>
  Missions are intended as a supplement to the main objective of the scenario played. Using missions, each player gets assigned a <strong>secondary objective</strong>. Succeeding or failing this objective can influence the outcome of game.
</p>

<p>
  As a bonus, The Command Post helps you automate the process of deciding on a scenario to play, and assigning a secret mission to each player.

    We welcome your suggestions! First, consider the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Missions are intended to add extra tactical depth and decision making to a game of Bolt Action.
    </li>
    <li>
      A mission takes the form of a <strong>secondary</strong> objective that is achievable by <strong>any</strong> force selection.
    </li>
    <li>
      Missions affect the outcome of, but are subordinate to, the main scenario.
    </li>
    <li>
      The player should have to dedicate a limited part of his/her force during a game to succeed in the mission - e.g. a specific unit for most of the game, several units during a single turn, or similar.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ideally, the succes of a mission can be determined either at a turn end phase or at the end of the game, based on e.g. whether one or more units or models are destroyed or on the table in a specific area. Missions should avoid relying on players' memory of how an hours long game progressed, turn by turn.
    </li>
  </ul>
