<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to the <strong>Command Post</strong> - a collection of tools and content to spice up your <strong>Bolt Action</strong> game.
</p>

<p>
  The <strong>Command Post</strong> is a hobby project made by <strong>Bolt Action</strong> fans.
</p>

<h2>About to start up a Bolt Action game?</h2>
<p>
  Use the <a href={$url('/generator')}>Generator</a> to roll a random Scenario from your choice of <strong>official</strong> and <strong>unofficial</strong> Scenarios.
</p>
<p>
  Include our unofficial <strong>missions</strong> to add extra tactical challenge and decision making to your game. Pick a mission manually, or use the <a href={$url('/generator')}>Generator</a> to get random secret missions assigned to each player.
</p>

<h2>Work in progress</h2>
<p>
  We have plans to expand the service to include battlefield conditions, nationality based missions and more.
</p>

<p>
   Please note that as of now this is a work in progress - therefore we kindly ask that you <a href={$url('/feedback')}>submit</a> any and all thoughts, ideas and any issues that you encounter while using the tool.
</p>

<h3>
  Thanks a lot for giving it a try.
