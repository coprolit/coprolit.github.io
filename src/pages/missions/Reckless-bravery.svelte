<h1>Reckless bravery</h1>

<h2>Intel</h2>
<blockquote>We must act in a strong, determined way to defeat the enemy. We must press the attack at all cost!</blockquote>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Do not use a Down order during a turn (at turn end phase, none of your units have a Down order next to them).</p>
